## Abstract

This ERC proposes a specification for an opaque token with focus on privacy. Privacy is achieved by representing balances as off-chain data encapsulated in hashes, referred to as "baskets". These baskets can be reorganized, transferred, and managed through token functions on-chain.

## Motivation

In [ERC-20](./eip-20.html), balances are transparent on-chain, with privacy being partially ensured through the use of pseudonyms for the sender and receiver. However, this transparency makes it challenging to work with smart contract accounts like Gnosis Safe or [ERC-725](./eip-725.html). Moreover, in regulated environments where KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures are required, revealing an identity would expose the entire portfolio of that identity from the on-chain data.

Without additional privacy mechanisms, the use of pseudonyms can only partially mask the sender's and receiver's identities. The chain of transactions remains visible on-chain, and once a pseudonym is de-masked, significant data and metadata about the holder's portfolio and business activities can be extracted. This transparency complicates the use of smart contract accounts and on-chain identities and claims, as they expose the entire portfolio of the associated identity.

This proposal allows for moving balances to off-chain storage, thereby enabling a good level of privacy, particularly for smart contract accounts.

## Specification

### Baskets

Balances are represented on-chain as hashes of the form:

```
keccak256(abi.encode(salt, tokenId, value))

// where  salt (bytes32)    - random 32bytes to increase the entropy and
//                            make brute-forcing the hash impossible
//        tokenId (bytes32) - a unique tokenId within token's smart contract instance
//        value (uint256)   - the value of the position
```

For the remainder of this document, we refer to these hashes as "baskets" because they conceal the balance information in an opaque manner, similar to how a covered basket hides its contents.

### Token Interface

```

  //

  struct SIGNATURE {
    uint8 v; bytes32 r; bytes32 s;
  }

    address[] oracles;        // valid oracles
  }

   */
  function burn(

}
```

### Off-chain Data Endpoints

The design requires off-chain storage for the details of the baskets. Providing the off-chain storage is in the responsibility of the operator of the token (e.g. issuer, or registrar). The operator MUST ensure the availability of the basket data and will share it on need-to-know basis with all eligible holders. (*TODO: authentication mechanism to be described. PUT/GET have diffferent requirements!*) Moreover, token holders SHOULD store details about their baskets in their own off-chain storage for the case that operator's service is unavailable.

REST API Endpoints for creating and querying baskets:

```
Endpoint: PUT basket
PostData:
{
  basket: keccak256(abi.encode(salt, tokenId, value)),
  data: {
    salt: <bytes32>,
    tokenId: <bytes32>,
    value: <uint256>
  }
}

Endpoint: GET basket?basket-hash=<bytes32>
Response:
{
  basket: keccak256(abi.encode(salt, tokenId, value)),
  data: {
    salt: <bytes32>,
    tokenId: <bytes32>,
    value: <uint256>
  }
}
```

REST API Endpoints for the token master data:

```
Endpoint: GET token?network-id=<number>&token-addr=<address>&token-id=<bytes32>
Description: returns all revisions of a token (sorted ascending) for a specific `token-id`
             in a ERC-7722 token instance identified by `network-id` and contract address `token-addr`.
             Mandatory fields are only `salt`, `tokenId`, and `revision`. The rest is token application
             specific. Moreover the algorithm used to deterministically stringy `data` JSON-object,
             which will compact render JSON to a string without blanks and with object fields sorted by name
             (e.g., as implemented in json-stringify-deterministic).
Response:
[
  {
    fingerprint: keccak256(<deterministically stringified `data` object>),
    data: {
      salt: <bytes32>,
      tokenId: <bytes32>,
      revision: <uint32>,
      ... additional token specific data as required ...
    }
  },
  ...
]
```

### reorg Endpoint

To ensure the integrity of a reorg and avoid accidental or fraudlent mints or burns, an oracle services is required. Oracles will sign any reorg proposal made by the basket holder where the sum of values in input baskets grouped by tokenId is equal the sum of values of the output baskets grouped by tokenId.

This endpoint requires no further authentication and can be used by anyone without restrictions.

This endpoint is stateless and requires only request data as input. The oracle endpoint must not persist data from the request.

```
Endpoint: POST reorg
PostData: 
{
  in: [
    {
      basket: keccak256(abi.encode(salt, tokenId, value)),
      data: {
        salt: <bytes32>,
        tokenId: <bytes32>,
        value: <uint256>
      }
    },
    ...
  ],
  out: [
    {
      basket: keccak256(abi.encode(salt, tokenId, value)),
      data: {
        salt: <bytes32>,
        tokenId: <bytes32>,
        value: <uint256>
      }
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Response: 
{
  // hash is signed with oracles private key
  // basketsIn and basketsIn are bytes32[]
  signature: sign(keccak256(abi.encode(basketsIn, basketsOut)))
}
```

Example for valid reorg requests (salt and hashes are omitted for better readability):

```
in : (..., token1, 10), (..., token1, 30), (..., token2, 5), (..., token2, 95)
out: (..., token1, 40), (..., token2, 100)

in : (..., token1, 40), (..., token2, 100)
out: (..., token1, 10), (..., token1, 30), (..., token2, 5), (..., token2, 95)
```

## Rationale

### Breaking the ERC-20 Compatibility

The transparency inherent in ERC-20 tokens presents a significant issue for reusable blockchain identities, such as defined by ERC-725. To address this, we prioritize privacy over ERC-20 compatibility, ensuring that token balances remain confidential. 

### Reorg Oracles

The trusted oracles and the minimum number of required signatures can be configured to achieve the desired level of decentralization.

The basket holder proposes the input and output baskets for the reorg, while the oracles are responsible for verifying that the sums of the values on both sides (input and output) are equal. This system allows for mutual control, ensuring that no single party can manipulate the process.

Fraudlent oracles can be tracked back on-chain, i.e., the system ensures weak-integrity at minimum.

Note that it would also possible to apply Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) to provide reorg proofs (see "Future Work"), however, we have chosen to use oracles for efficiency and simplicity reasons.

### Off-chain Data Storage

We have chosen the token operator, which in most cases will be the issuer or registrar, as the initial and main source for off-chain data. This is acceptable, since they must know anyway which investor holds which positions to manage lifecycle events on the token. While this approach may not be suitable for every use case within the broader Ethereum ecosystem, it fits well the financial instruments in the regulated environment of the financial industry, which rely on strict KYC and token operation procedures.

### Authentication Mechanism

The data provider will determine whether an entity can query the data based on the basket ownership. To verify the requester's eligibility to access the data, the requester must sign the request using a key associated with the address to which the token is assigned. does not have to be the direct private key of the address, as we also aim to support smart contract accounts. *TODO: authentication mechanism is to be defined yet*

### Future Work: ZKP as alterantive to Oracles

Instead of using oracles in the future, it would also be possible to apply zero knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to verify if the sum of values from input baskets matches the sum of the values of the output baskets.

### Future Work: Differential Privacy

To further strengtehn the privacy and obscure who is transacting with whome, an additional layer of noise can be introduced through empty transfers and reorgs. For example, a basket can be split into multiple baskets, some of which might have a value of 0. During a transfer, these "empty" baskets can be sent to random receivers. This approach makes it more challenging to analyze and interpret on-chain data.

### Future Work: Unifying fungible and non-fungible 
If reorg function is disabled, we disable the fungibility of the token and it becomes a NFT.
